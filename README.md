Module 9 Challenge
The sql source files create sql tables for each of the csv files in the data folder.
These tables include columns that list an employee's first and last names, their ID number, salaries, titles, and department names that they work for.
The csv files were imported into the database in sequence due to certain tables relying on other tables for their primary key.
Data analysis was performed on these tables utilizing primary, foreign keys, and inner joins to combine data and display it.
Aliases were not functioning as anticipated and were therefore omitted to be debugged at a later date.
